- **P2 (Nice-to-have)**: Future enhancements not included in this plan

## Key Milestones

1. **MVP Ready** (End of Phase 3): Basic timer with start/stop, session management, and export
2. **Feature Complete** (End of Phase 4): All P0 features implemented with theming and settings
3. **Enhanced Version** (End of Phase 5): P1 features including reminders and visualization
4. **Production Ready** (End of Phase 6): Fully tested, secured, and packaged application

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Start/Stop always works from main window, tray, and global shortcut
- [ ] System sleep/lock stops active session within 1s and persists it
- [ ] No overlapping sessions can exist after any operation
- [ ] Today's total updates within 1s of change
- [ ] Export produces correct totals for boundary conditions (midnight crossing, DST)
- [ ] Settings persist across restarts; global shortcut remains registered if valid
- [ ] Reminders behave per configuration and never fire while tracking
